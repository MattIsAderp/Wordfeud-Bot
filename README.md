# Wordfeud-helper-in-Python
This is a program in which you input your current board, and your rack of letters, the program will then scan the board 
and find the best possible word for you to place, where to place it, and whether to place it as a row, or as a column.

The program uses a list of words called "SOWPODS", so if you do want to use this to beat people in Wordfeud, make sure you're
playing the game in "English International: SOWPODS", it is possible to add new lists of words for other languages, I've tried
this with Dutch, but unfortunately I wasn't able to find a perfect one, it was missing a lot of words, and also had a lot of words
that Wordfeud didn't accept, which is why I added a blacklist for words.

Please ONLY this for regular games or learning purposes, do NOT use this for tournaments.

This is my first repository on github, and also one of my first python projects, so any comments on how to improve would be greatly appreciated! :)
